          <h5>Little more about me</h5>
          <p>I'm 28, living with my partner and pets. I'm a passionate learner with a background in early childhood 
            pedagogy, having worked as an educator for several years. I enjoy reading, cooking, and motorcycle travel. 
            Two years ago, I made a career change to software development for its dynamic nature and personal growth
            opportunities. Although I lack professional experience, I've actively contributed to various projects, applying 
            my knowledge in technologies like React, Redux, Spring Boot, and languages such as Java, JavaScript, and 
            TypeScript, along with MySQL and MongoDB databases. I'm also conversationally proficient in English.
            I'm a proactive team player who finds value in helping others. I tend to prioritize tasks based on their 
            importance and use lists to manage them effectively. Continuous learning is my passion, whether
            independently or through collaboration with peers.</p>
